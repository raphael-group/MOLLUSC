- when running as a job array on cluster, several of the experiments (all *_r2 for some reason) throw a keyerror for a node (line 72), which the surrounding if statement should catch. when running not as a job array (just running the command) it doesn't have this error, and it only happens for beta=0.5 for some reason as well (trying beta = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20), so i'm not sure if it's a real error or some quirk of the cluster.
